    <title>When to use "=" vs. "==" vs. ".equals"</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Not all signs are created ==</h1>
    <p>Contrary to what we all were taught growing up in math class, this '='
      sign is not the sign for equals in Java. At least not in the way we are
      all used to.</p>
    <p>Each of these signs
      <ul>
        <li>=</li>
        <li>==</li>
        <li>.equals</li>
      </ul>
      either compare or create.</p>
    <p>Starting with "=". <br>This symbol when used in Java programming is used
      as an initializer. For example the picture below shows this symbol being
      used to initialize a variable. It connects the name of the variable to the
      variables assigned value.<br><img src="../images/Var-init-screenshot.png"></p>
    <p>The difference between "=" and the others is that "=" is the only one not
      comparing two values. <br>"==" is used to compare two integers be that an
      int or a double. It compares the two values for their equality. This can be
      below in the picture <br><img src="../images/comparing-numbers-screenshot.png"></p>
    <p>Last but definitely equal to the others is ".equals". This is used to compare
      the equality of two strings. An example of this would look something like
      this picture below. <br><img src="../images/comparing-string-screenshot"></p>
