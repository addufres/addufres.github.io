    <p>What do those words mean at the beginning of any method in Java? Well I
    will update you on the rest when I know what they do, but for now we will focus
    on the third word of the bunch. In some cases it is "void", in others it
    could be <br>
    <ul>
    <li>double</li>
    <li>int</li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Boolean</li>
    </ul>
    The difference between "void" and the other options is quite simple. When you
    plan on returning a value at the end of a method, use the data type your returned
    value will be. So, if you will be returning the name of a person set the data
    type to "String". If you are getting a whole number, use "int", so on and so
    forth.</p>
    <p>However in a method using "void", no return value is expected. This would
      used in your main since it will be doing rather than returning. If a teacher
      asked you to come write the number four on the board and you had a java
      program that could do this it would use the "void" for its method. Though
      if your teacher wants you to come up to the board and think of a number and
      then tell the teacher that number, the method would use the data type of
      "double".</p>
