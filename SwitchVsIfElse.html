    <title>Why use SWITCH, IF there is something ELSE</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>IF ELSE SWITCH</h1>
    <p>From what I have learned so far about these to ways to make decisions,
      in the grand scheme of things there isn't a huge difference. For example,
      they both decide an outcome based on a given set of rules prescribed
      beforehand. The difference however is how those predetermined rules are
      implemented during the decision making process.</p>
    <p>Say you are writing a program to display how many days are in each month.
      using an IF/ELSE statement would accomplish part of this goal by examining
      user input to determine which month they want to know the number of days for.
      this is easiest done with an IF/ELSE statement. IF the user input matches
      the comparison criterium it runs the code within. ELSE it moves to the next
      IF statement.</p>

    <p>Now a SWITCH statement could have accomplished that however it is better
      suited to accomplish tasks that require multiple criteria. In our example,
      we have now figured out which month the user wants to find the number of
      days for by comparing the number the gave to the computer through the Scanner
      method. What SWITCH can do is continue dropping the variable through the
      comparisons all at once. So in this next picture The months all will meet
      certain lengths but may meet multiple options as well. The SWITCH statement
      allows the computer to say that it knows that months 9, 4, 6, and 11 will all
      meet the same criteria. So as the months are checked all those are lumped to one.
      This saves time and space in the code over using IF/ELSE for this portion.</p>
