    <h1>What have I done and what I will create</h1>

    <p>I can say this one will be short and sweet. Up until about a year ago I never
    entertained the idea of becoming a programmer past making changes to simple
    webpages using the most basic of html using the inspect feature in Chrome. My
    best friend was the one who turned my head to a career in tech. He attended a
    similar program and said he thought I should give it a try.

    So here I am a year later and haven't been able to learn as much as I hoped on
    my own. I have lacked mainly in the understanding of the architecture and how
    programs are put together. The syntax was fairly easy to get down as it is fairly
    standard rote memorization.

    Throughout the program I would like to explore different aspects of the types
    of programs created with the Java language and other APIs we will use. As I
    currently do not have a real idea as to what those are I am not sure what I
    will be able to create. However that being said I do know that I see great value
    writing programs that make life easier for others.

    For example, I have a considerable amount of experience with marketing online
    and SEO principles. I have had several issues with various programs I have
    used over the years that I feel I could have fixed had I known how to program.

    After the course I hope to be able to attain work doing just that for companies.
    And in the long run I would like to have my own software for sale.
